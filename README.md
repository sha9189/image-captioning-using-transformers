# Image Caption Generator Using Transformer Architecture

This project is an Image Captioning System developed to describe different scenes of a house (like living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, etc). Its architecture has been influenced by the recent success of the [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr) (DEtection-TRansformer) model on the task of Object Detection.
